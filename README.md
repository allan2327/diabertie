This is diabertie, your personal diabetes chatbot.
It uses the awesome [Telegram chat bot integration](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
You can send bertie your blood sugar values, insulin doses and whatever is important for your daily diabetes logging.

To use it, you can head over to diabertie.com, create an account and connect it to the bot from there.
